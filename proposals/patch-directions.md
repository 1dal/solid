# Directions for patch distribution

Currently (2017-01) the solid code sends patches -- notification
 of small changed to a possibly large file -- from
client to server in a HTTP PATCH command.  The server

Note a difference between the solid-ui system and some other distrubuted system
is that  the client does NOT save a file and then hand it to a sync system to
figure out what changed: instead the client specifically generates an patch.
So while often in the literature the patch file is called a "diff", and it
does express the differences between the old version and the new version of
the graph, it has not been generated by a program like unix's 'diff'.


 * When listening for updates, the client should get a patch instead of a ping.
 * Extend the patch format to allow multiple files to be patched as an atomic operation
 * When receiving a stream of updates, the server could cache the graph in memory, not reading it again from the file system
 * Further the server doesn't write back the patched file every patch, only every few seconds.
 * When clients of listening to the same resource are in fact located physically close, they could exchange patches
